I will probably have a page dedicated for the whole team and a page dedicated for messi, so a navbar at the top and bottom of the page will make for easy access to different sections. I want the website to be color-coded with the Barcelon colors. One data visualization option I could have is a bar graph representing how many goals messi scored against different opponents. The user will have a dropdown where he can select multiple opponents and they will appear on the barchart. This will give a clean showcase of how messi's goals stacked up against different opponents. The opponents will be on the x axis, and goals on the y. I will likely make a similar thing to his assitors. Additionally I will add a line graph to show how his goals stacked up over the years. The x axis will be time (increasing by margins of a season), and the y axis will be the total goals he scored throughout his career. When hovering over points, you could see the individual date and how many goals were cored on that date and the total goals scored up until then. There can be a range slider to decide on the amount of years that would be shown on the x axis. I could also make a pie chart to show the distribution of the type of goal he scored (left foot, right foot, header, volley, chest...) I would also like to have graphics for both the team and for messi for the amount of trophies they won with an image of the trophy and a count below it."
